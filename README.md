# Springboard-DataScience-Foundations
Submission of exercises, milestones and my capstone project.

Hey all. So far I think I'd be pretty interested in exploring the applications of R & data science techniques to create some insights on renewable energy, or organic agriculture and permaculture. 

# 1st Idea: Analysis on Solar Energy
Specifically, I hope to look at production and revenue, and job growth/labour statistics in comparison with fossil fuels and the rest of the energy sector. The US Dept of Energy, and US Bureau of Labour Statistics has quite a bit of current data, and I hope to explore the situation in other countries as well if it isn't too much work. The current data is easily viewable but I'm still hopeful I'll be able to compare with past levels of employment and production. By taking historic data I'll try to model predictions on the future growth/decreases, and possibly make ammendments based on new policy developments (Trump renewables decrease, Supportive Renewables policy mostly everywhere else)

Bureau of Labour Statistics info on wages: https://www.bls.gov/green/solar_power/solar_power.pdf (also includes lots of sources with more relevant info)
Insight could be most relevant for job-seekers and students deciding on what to become trained in, employers, policymakers and energy producing companies at the municipal, state and international levels.

# 2nd Idea: Analysis on Agriculture
I'd also like to take a look at the impact and growth of urban agriculture across the world. Along with big data and machine learning being part of new ways to help solve problems, urbanisation and population growth are part of growing problems of environmental degradation and climate change. As it's something which encompasses so many different aspects such as nutritional quality, input and environmental effects, economic impact, social impacts and more, I'm not yet too sure about how I would approach the topic. I'm confident that I'll be able to find lots of statistics on agriculture through the UN Food n Agriculture Organisation, although I'm not sure if much will be relevant to urban ag, or organic ag, which I'm more specifically interested in.

Insights could help effect decisions made by farmers, food companies, local grocers, and policy makers at the municipal, state, country, and regional levels.

# 3rd Idea: ?
