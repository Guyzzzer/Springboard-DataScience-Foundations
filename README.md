# Springboard-DataScience-Foundations
Submission of exercises, milestones and my capstone project.

Hey all. So far I think I'd be pretty interested in exploring the applications of R & data science techniques to create some insights on renewable energy, or organic agriculture and permaculture. 

## 1st Idea: Analysis on Solar Energy

Specifically, I hope to look at production and revenue, and job growth/labour statistics in comparison with fossil fuels and the rest of the energy sector. The US Dept of Energy, and US Bureau of Labour Statistics has quite a bit of current data, and I hope to explore the situation in other countries as well if it isn't too much work. The current data is easily viewable but I'm still hopeful I'll be able to compare with past levels of employment and production. By taking historic data I'll try to model predictions on the future growth/decreases, and possibly make ammendments based on new policy developments (Trump renewables decrease, Supportive Renewables policy mostly everywhere else)

-Bureau of Labour Statistics info on wages: https://www.bls.gov/green/solar_power/solar_power.pdf (also includes lots of sources with more relevant info)
Insight could be most relevant for job-seekers and students deciding on what to become trained in, employers, policymakers and energy producing companies at the municipal, state and international levels.

## 2nd Idea: Analysis on Agriculture

I'd also like to take a look at the impact and growth of urban agriculture across the world. Along with big data and machine learning being part of new ways to help solve problems, urbanisation and population growth are part of growing problems of environmental degradation and climate change. As it's something which encompasses so many different aspects such as nutritional quality, input and environmental effects, economic impact, social impacts and more, I'm not yet too sure about how I would approach the topic. I'm confident that I'll be able to find lots of statistics on agriculture through the UN Food n Agriculture Organisation, although I'm not sure if much will be relevant to urban ag, or organic ag, which I'm more specifically interested in.

Insights could help effect decisions made by farmers, food companies, local grocers, and policy makers at the municipal, state, country, and regional levels.

## 3rd Idea: Analysis on the relative safety and function of oil&gas pipelines in the US

After much deliberation another idea I had was to examine the relationship between water security and contaminants dispersed from ruptured oil pipelines. In the US there is a very high amount of pipeline leaks every year, and a significant portion of those affect nearby bodies of water, usually those which support a town's drinking water needs, or local aquatic life. There exists a decent amount of info pertaining to accidents in the oil industry, although I think I'd decide to focus on pipeline leaks rather than oceanic spills from tankers. Although tanker spills have a huge and long lasting impact I think it'll be easier to measure and predict the effects of smaller-scale leaks due to a higher frequency and longer history. At the moment I've found quite a lot of data spanning back roughly 40 years on all sorts of different factors involving the safety programs involved with pipelines as well as law-mandated incident/accident reports which also contain many different data points on the effects. 

To get a good start on understanding the current energy pipeline ecosystem in the US this article gives a good outline:
https://www.propublica.org/article/pipelines-explained-how-safe-are-americas-2.5-million-miles-of-pipelines /// and it includes data on specific safety and incident points.

https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline the US has a gov't agency called the pipeline & hazardous materials safety administration, and the website has a wide array of materials to inform industry practice. Combing the many different areas of the site have helped me to gain an understanding on the types of info publicly available: as a pleasant surprise, theres roughly 40 years worth of .txt files easily convertible to excel>csv formats on the pipeline systems, ranging from safety programs, cost of damages, materials used in construction, incidents, etc. Barring missing values and some irrelevant data its all decently clean, and I think there's good potential for analysing relationships between different factors such as age of pipelines, safety programs enacted and incidents. 
After deliberation on the US's bureau of labour stats and some IRENA data on the growth of solar jobs I've been leaning towards this one since I had the idea.
