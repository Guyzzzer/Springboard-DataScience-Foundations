# Springboard-DataScience-Foundations
Submission of exercises, milestones and my capstone project.

Hey all. So far I think I'd be pretty interested in exploring the applications of R & data science techniques to create some insights on renewable energy, or organic agriculture and permaculture. 

## 1st Idea: Analysis on Solar Energy

Specifically, I hope to look at production and revenue, and job growth/labour statistics in comparison with fossil fuels and the rest of the energy sector. The US Dept of Energy, and US Bureau of Labour Statistics has quite a bit of current data, and I hope to explore the situation in other countries as well if it isn't too much work. The current data is easily viewable but I'm still hopeful I'll be able to compare with past levels of employment and production. By taking historic data I'll try to model predictions on the future growth/decreases, and possibly make ammendments based on new policy developments (Trump renewables decrease, Supportive Renewables policy mostly everywhere else)

-Bureau of Labour Statistics info on wages: https://www.bls.gov/green/solar_power/solar_power.pdf (also includes lots of sources with more relevant info)
Insight could be most relevant for job-seekers and students deciding on what to become trained in, employers, policymakers and energy producing companies at the municipal, state and international levels.

## 2nd Idea: Analysis on Agriculture

I'd also like to take a look at the impact and growth of urban agriculture across the world. Along with big data and machine learning being part of new ways to help solve problems, urbanisation and population growth are part of growing problems of environmental degradation and climate change. As it's something which encompasses so many different aspects such as nutritional quality, input and environmental effects, economic impact, social impacts and more, I'm not yet too sure about how I would approach the topic. I'm confident that I'll be able to find lots of statistics on agriculture through the UN Food n Agriculture Organisation, although I'm not sure if much will be relevant to urban ag, or organic ag, which I'm more specifically interested in.

Insights could help effect decisions made by farmers, food companies, local grocers, and policy makers at the municipal, state, country, and regional levels.

## 3rd Idea: Analysis on the relationships between Oil Leaks & Water

After much deliberation another idea I had was to examine the relationship between water security and contaminants dispersed from ruptured oil pipelines. In the US there is a very high amount of pipeline leaks every year, and a significant portion of those affect nearby bodies of water, usually those which support a town's drinking water needs, or local aquatic life. There exists a decent amount of info pertaining to accidents in the oil industry, although I think I'd decide to focus on pipeline leaks rather than oceanic spills from tankers. Although tanker spills have a huge and long lasting impact I think it'll be easier to measure and predict the effects of smaller-scale leaks on surrounding municipalities, ecosystems and watersheds. 
Some sources of data I'd look at:

https://www.propublica.org/article/pipelines-explained-how-safe-are-americas-2.5-million-miles-of-pipelines this article explains the different factors of risk that a pipeline can exhibit, and can help me form an idea of what data points to identify when predicting the probability new leaks

https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline the US has a gov't agency called the pipeline & hazardous materials safety administration, and the website has a wide array of materials to inform industry practice. Going through it will help me understand more about the risk factors and best practices, as well as some of the regulations in place that may have been different in the past.
Finally, I will search for occurrences where a pipeline crosses a river or body of water and the details regarding the people and ecosystem relying on that water.
